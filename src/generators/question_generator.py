            - Questions that require detailed structured responses.

        Solve-Type Questions:
            - Questions that present a problem or scenario

            - Questions where a definition is provided and learners must identify the corresponding concept.

        Ordering type Questions:
            - Questions where a sequence of steps or events is provided and learners must correctly order the steps or events in their proper order.

        Respond with any of the following.
